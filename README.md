# Cafe (powered by rust)
If you love coffee this is a the repo for you! There are many ways to make coffee, and that
leads to confusion about things like
1. Grind-size
2. What type of coffee should I use
3. What kind of roast is best
4. What ratio of water to coffee do I need
5. What is the best technique for each method

This tool aims to fix that problem!

# How to use the tool
Right now the only way to use the tool is compile it yourself; You will need the rust compiler
installed. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust has instructions on how to install the rust
compiler.

# Thank You
